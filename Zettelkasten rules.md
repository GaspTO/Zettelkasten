## Structure
* There are two *boxes*: Bibliographic and Main. 
* The **Bibliographic Box** holds a note for each outside reference. This can be a paper, a book, a chapter of a book, a blog post, a youtube video... It is used for notes to cite and refer to outside information.
	*  The bibliographic will, at least for books and papers, use the APA style, both for citation and reference. The citation appears in the title, and the reference is put in the source section. I haven't found an automatic way of citing in this style, so here's a [link](https://www.scribbr.com/citation/generator/apa/#:~:text=in%2Dtext%20citations-,The%20basics,entry%20in%20the%20reference%20list.) about the APA citation style.
	* If relevant, a brief summary explaining the reference might be given in the content section. Be careful not to explain the idea of the paper in the bibliographic notes. For example, in the paper that introduce resnets, you shouldn't explain resnets, but, perhaps, give some context about the paper, its relevancy and assert what the idea is (without explaining it).
	* Bibliographic notes should only refer to other bibliographic notes. 
* The **Main Box** holds the notes of the information and ideas we want to record. The notes can be about information/ideas we want to remember or ideas we thought of. The objective is to build upon different ideas, creating connections to grow our knowledge.

## Tags
* Tags are used as the hub and structure nodes in the zettelkasten method. Tags are used to cluster notes. 
* While the content section of each note should not be modified by norm (although it can happen), the tag section can and should be. As the graph expands, new clusters might be needed and, therefore, the addition of tags might be necessary as time goes on.
* There is at least one tag every note needs to have relating where it comes from:
	* Bibliographic ones need to have #bibliography. 
	* Those in the main box need to have a tag indicating where the idea or information comes from.
		* If it is an original reasoning/thought we use #original 
		* if it is from an external source, #external 
		* if it is an established piece of information that goes around without, necessarily, a source, #established 
		* if it is the result of an experiment, #experimental 
* There are different types of *notes*. 
	* There are description of ideas (e.g. what is a resnet?)
	* There are assertions with a veracity value (e.g. resnets scale well). Use #assertion for these.
	* Questions should be marked as #question
