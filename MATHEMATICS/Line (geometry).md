In geometry, intuitively, a **line** is an infinitely long object with no width, depth, or curvature. They are one-dimensional objects that might exist in two, three or higher dimension spaces. 

In modern geometry, a line is simply taken as an undefined object (a so-called *primitive* object) with properties given by axioms  but is sometimes defined as a set of points obeying a linear relationship when some other fundamental concept is left undefined. In an axiomatic formulation of Euclidean geometry, such as that of Hilbert (Euclid's original axioms contained various flaws which have been corrected by modern mathematicians), a line is stated to have certain properties which relate it to other lines and points.
