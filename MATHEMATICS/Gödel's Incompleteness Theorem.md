## Theorem
In any consistent formalization of mathematics that is sufficiently strong to axiomatize the natural numbers — that is, sufficiently strong to define the operations that collectively define the natural numbers — one can construct a true statement that can be neither proved nor disproved within that system itself

## Overview
This was a *revolutionary* theorem that has a tremendous impact in mathematics. It pretty much says that it is not possible to formulate an axiomatic system which is complete (all mathematical truths can derived) and consistent (no statement can be proven true and false at the same time). This was opposite to many mathematician's opinions, like Hilbert, Russel, and Whitehead.

## Proof
Proven.
