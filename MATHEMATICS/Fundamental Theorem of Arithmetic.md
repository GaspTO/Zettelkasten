## Theorem
Every natural number $n \geq 2$ is either a prime number of the product of prime numbers, and the product is unique up to the order in which the factors appear.

## Overall
It's a corollary of [[Euclid's First Theorem]].
It means that the prime numbers are the elementary elements of numbers.
This theorem doesn't help to identify whether or not a number is prime.

## Proof
Proved.
