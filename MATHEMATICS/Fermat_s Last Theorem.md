## Theorem
$x^n + y^n = z^n$ has no nonzero integer solutions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ when $n \gt 2$.

## Overview
This is one of the most famous theorems in mathematics, which was an open conjecture for more than 300 years. It was finally solved by Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor in 1995.

## Proof
Proven.
