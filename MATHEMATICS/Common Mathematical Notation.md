In the communication of mathematics it is often useful to write mathematical sentences using symbols rather than words. Effectively communicating mathematical ideas is like writing an essay; it requires well-composed sentences, paragraphs, and correct mathematical grammar. Over the years, mathematicians have created their own language on the basis of standard mathematical shorthand.

It follows a summary of some notation used in [[RJ Rossi (2021)]].
* **Natural Numbers** : $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4,...\}$
* **Whole Numbers** : $\mathbb{W} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4,...\}$
* **Integers**: $\mathbb{Z} = \{0, \pm1, \pm2, \pm3, \pm4,...\}$
* **Rationals** : $\mathbb{Q} = \{q : q = \frac{p}{r} \text{ for } p \text{ and } r \neq 0  \text{ integers}\}$ 
* **Reals**: $\mathbb{R} = \{x : -\infty < x < \infty \}$
* **Positive Reals**: $\mathbb{R}^+ = \{x : 0 < x < \infty \}$
* **Negative Reals**: $\mathbb{R}^- = \{x : -\infty < x < 0 \}$
* **Irrationals** : $\mathbb{I} = \{r : r \text{ is a real number but no rational} \}$
* **Complex Numbers** : $\mathbb{C} = \{\xi : \xi = a + bi, \text{  } a, b \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } i = \sqrt{-1}$
Notation analogous to **Positive** and **Negative** reals can also be used with **Integers**, **Rationals** and **Irrationals**.


For the intervals in $\mathbb{R}$, we use the standard notation:
* **Open Intervals**: The open interval containing the points lying strictly between two endpoints, say, a and b, i denoted by $(a,b)$. It can also be represented by $a \lt x \lt b$. Note that either $a$ or $b$, or both $a$ and $b$ may be $\infty$. In particular, $\mathbb{R} == (-\infty,\infty)$.
* **Closed intervals**: The closed interval containing the points lying between and including two finite endpoints, say, $a$ and $b$, is denoted by $[a,b]$.
* **Half-Open Intervals**: The half-open/half-closed intervals contain all the points lying strictly between the endpoints $a$ and $b$ and either $a$ or $b$, but not both $a$ and $b$, is denoted by $(a,b]$ or $[a,b)$.


Some common symbols:
* $:=$ is often used for *defined to be*. For example, the notation $:=$ might be used in defining the set $\mathbb{Z}_E$ that contains the even integers as follows $\mathbb{Z}_{E} := \{x \in \mathbb{Z} : x = 2z \text{ for some integer } z.\}$
* s.t. or $\ni :$ is read *such that*. For example, the statement "there exists $x \gt 0$  such that $f(x) = 0$ could be written as "there exists $x \gt 0  \ni: f(x) = 0$
* $\in$ is often used for *is an element of* or *is a member of*. 
* $x!$ is used to denote *x factorial*, where, for a positive integer $x$, $x! = x(x-1)(x-2)...3\cdot2\cdot1$ 
* $\sum$ is a mathematical shorthand for summation. For example $\sum_{n=0}^2 n = 0 + 1 + 2$.
* $\prod$ is shorthand for product. 
* $\forall$ stands *for all*.
* $\exists$ stands *there exists*.
* $\infty$ means the concept of the unbounded quantity "infinity".
* $\implies$ or $\rightarrow$ stands for *implies*.
* $\iff$ or $\leftrightarrow$  stands of *if and only if*.
