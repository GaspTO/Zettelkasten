The accumulator array refers to a discretization of a vector space into *bins*. Each bin has a sub-interval of the vector space. For example, the first bin the first quadrant (for $\mathbb{R}^2$) can be given by $x,y \in [0,2]$ and, another one can be given by $x,y \in [2,4]$

Each bin holds values, like an integer, usually initialized at 0. 

There's two decisions to make regarding this array: 
* which part of the vector it covers (since the array is finite and not the space)
* size of each bin.
