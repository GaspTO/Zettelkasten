Inductive reasoning isn't the main tool chosen to prove statements. However, conjectures are often created using inductive reasoning.

For a conjecture to be proven  using inductive reasoning, two conditions have to be met
1. there are finitely many cases to consider in a conjecture
2. all the possible cases have been considered and the conjecture has been shown true in each of those

However, in general, this isn't the case of most conjectures.
