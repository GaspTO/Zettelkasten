## Definition
A [[Real-valued Sequence]] $a_n$ is said *converge* to a limit $a$ if and only if for every $\epsilon \gt 0$, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|a_n - a| \lt \epsilon$, whenever $n \geq N$. When the sequence $a_n$ converges to a limit $a$, this will be denoted by either $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}  a_n = a$; if a sequence does not converge, it is said to *diverge*.
