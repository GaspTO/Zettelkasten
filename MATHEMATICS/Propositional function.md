## Definition
A declarative sentence $P(x)$ involving a variable $x$ that takes on values in a set $\Delta$ is said to be a *propositional function* if and only if $P(x)$ has a well-defined truth value for each value of $x$ in $\Delta$. The set of $\Delta$ is called the domain of the propositional function $P(x)$.

## Overview
Note that a propositional function is a declarative sentence containing a variable whose truth depends on the specific value of the variable. Thus, the truth or falsity of a propositional function cannot be determined without knowing a specific value of the unknown variable.

For example, the declarative sentence $x^2 - 4 = 0$ is a propositional function that is true when $x \pm 2$ and false otherwise.
