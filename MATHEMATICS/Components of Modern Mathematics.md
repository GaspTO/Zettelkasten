The components of the modern axiomatic mathematical system are the *axioms*, *definitions*, *conjectures*, *proofs*, *theorems*, *corollaries*, *lemmas*, and *counterexamples*

[[Axiom|Axioms]] [[Axioms]] and the [[Mathematical definition|Definitions]] are the basic components that make up an **axiomatic mathematical system**. From these, new mathematical results are added using **deductive reasoning**.

The addition of new mathematical results follows from making hypotheses concerning  the implications of the axioms and definitions (and previous results). When the truth of a hypothesize result is not yet known, the result is called a [[Conjecture]].

A [[Conjecture]] can be created using **inductive reasoning**, but can only be proven using **deductive reasoning**. The series of steps from the latter, which explain why a certain result is true, is called [[Mathematical Proof| Proof]].

Once a [[Mathematical Proof|Proof]] has been created, the [[Conjecture]] can now be called a [[Theorem]].


* **Proof** : The logically deductive argument demonstrating why a statement is true.
* **Theorem** : a statement that has been proven to be true.
* **Lemma**: a short theorem used to prove a larger theorem.
* **Proposition** : proven result larger than a lemma, but smaller than a theorem.
* **Corollary** : A true statement that is a simple deduction from a theorem or proposition. Usually a consequence of a statement just proven.

* **Primitive notion** :  see [[Primitive Notion]].
