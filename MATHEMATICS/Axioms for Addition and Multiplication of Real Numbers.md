## Axioms
* **A1:** $a + b = b + a$ ([[Commutativity|commutative property]]  of addition)
* **A2:** $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$ ([[Associativity|associative property]] of addition)
* **A3:** $a + 0 = a$
* **A4:** $a + -a = 0$
* **A5:** $ab = ba$ ([[Commutativity|commutative property]] of multiplication)
* **A6:** $a(bc) = (ab)c$ ([[Associativity|associative property]] of multiplication)
* **A7:** $a \times 1$ = a
* **A8:** $\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } \mathbb{R}$  are [[Closure|closed]] under addition
* **A9**: $\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } \mathbb{R}$ are [[Closure|closed]] under multiplication

##  Note
[[RJ Rossi (2021)]] states these axioms, but doesn't say they are necessary. They actually seem to follow from the definition of multiplication and addition, without needing to be postulates. Maybe, they are simply assuming them to be easier.
