# Content
To define a concept, you need previous concepts, and so on... which makes it impossible to define a first concept (this is known as the the infinite regress problem).

The primitive notions are concepts defined without using previously-defined concepts to avoid this problem. Every formal theory needs, for this exact reason, some primitive notions.

Examples are, in contemporary geometry, *point*, *line*, *contains*... Instead of defining them, their relationship and use is constrained by axioms like *For every two **points** there exists a **line** that contains both of them*.
