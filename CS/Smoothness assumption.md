This is a [[Assumptions of semi-supervised learning|semi-supervised assumption]] that assumes that two input points that are close in the input space are more likely to share the same label.

This assumption carries transitivity: if $x_1$ is close to $x_2$ and $x_3$ is close to $x_2$ , then $x_3$ should have the same label as $x_1$.
