Remember that first paper of mathilde caron where she clusters with k-means samples?

Well, that, I think, explores the natural properties captured by the convolutional neural network. 

I wonder whether pre-trained the first-layer of a cnn, in such way that it learns the gaborfilters, and only then, with that cnn, do that clustering, it might improve the method.
