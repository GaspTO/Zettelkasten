## Content
The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge is a benchmark in [[Object recognition]] and [[Object detection]] on hundreds of object categories and millions of images.

The training dataset is released to the public alongside its annotations. The test set is also released but without the annotations. Researchers can then train on these datasets and submit the models to a public server that then evaluates them in order for the results to be officially published by the end of the challenge.
