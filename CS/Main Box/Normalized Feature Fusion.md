## Content
It's a type of [[Weighted Feature Fusion|weighted feature fusion technique]], where each feature map, $I_i$ , is given some importance according to the normalization of their corresponding weights, $w_i$.
$$\begin{equation}
\sum_i \frac{w_i}{\epsilon + \sum_j w_j} \cdot I_i
\end{equation}$$
