In [[He et al. (2016)]], during the results between 34 and 18 layered [[ResNet]] (written in [[ResNets are better than Plain Networks]]), the [[degradation problem]] is observed in plain networks and solved in using the [[Residual connection| residual connections]].  

However the authors say that they verify the norms of the gradients propagated backwards and they seem to be normal, not vanishing. They, therefore, argue that this degradation problem is not caused by [[vanishing gradient| vanishing gradients]].
