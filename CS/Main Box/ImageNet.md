ImageNet is a dataset of images mostly used for [[Object recognition]]. Networks are trained to learn how to classify the images presented and are then evaluated on it. It has 1000 different classes of images and 14,197,122 images.

The challenge associated with it is called [[ILSVRC|ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)]]. 

As networks evolved and started to get bigger and more accurate results in this benchmark, different versions of this dataset were created.
