[[Convolutional operation|convolutional operations]] are [[Cross-correlation operation|cross-correlations]] with a flipped kernel.

The following example shows a cross-correlation with a particular kernel:

If we take the previous kernel and apply a convolution, it would be the same as flipping the kernel and applying a cross-correlation, as seen in the following image:
