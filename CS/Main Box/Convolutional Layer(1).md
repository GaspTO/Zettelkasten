## Content
A convolutional layer can be seen as a block of layers that [[Goodfellow et al. (2016)]] calls *stages*, where one of them is a [[Convolution Stage]].

Usually, there are two other stages that are associated with: the [[Detector Stage|detector stage]] and [[Pooling layer|pooling stage]]. More recently, [[Batch Normalization|batch normalization]] has been introduced in convolutional layer.

Here's a terminology scheme by [[Goodfellow et al. (2016)]]:
