Faster r-cnn is a method for [[Object detection]], which is a faster version of the [[Fast R-CNN]]. It was proposed in order to address the drawback of depending on an external algorithm to propose regions of interest.

The Faster R-CNN is composed by two modules. The first is a [[Region Proposal Network|region proposal network (RPN)]] that proposes regions. The second is the fast r-cnn, that uses the previous proposed regions.

A summary of the method can be seen in the following image:
