If we denote a function/mapping we desire to learn by $\mathcal{H}(x)$. The residual mapping is $F(x) = H(x) - x$. In other words, the residue is the difference between the desired output and the input. 

The desired function can then be seen as $F(x) + x$. This is particularly interesting because sometimes it is easier to find the difference between the input and output (the residue) than to find the desired function from scratch.
