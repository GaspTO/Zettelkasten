## Content
A hidden unit is, in the context of [[Artificial Neural Network|neural networks]], the neurons inside the hidden layers. These result from the application of  a non-linear function, $\phi$, to the [[Output unit activation]] :
$$\begin{equation}
	z_j = \phi(a_j)= \phi(\sum_{i=1}^{D} w_{ji} + w_{j0})
\end{equation}$$
