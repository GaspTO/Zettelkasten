This is a [[Assumptions of semi-supervised learning|semi-supervised assumption]] that states that the decision boundary of a classifier should pass through low-density regions in the input space. In simpler words, the decision boundary should pass *in-between* places with many points

This assumption can be thought as the counter-part of the [[Smoothness assumption]], because, if the decision boundary is passing through a region with many points, according to the smoothness assumption, they all belong to the same label, making the decision boundary wrong.
