Pre-training of [[Object detection|object detectors]] and segmentation models became the norm. But this study shows that is not necessarily true. They study the role of normalization, which is very important if a network is being trained from scratch, and longer training times. 

They find that using only [[MS COCO]] data, models trained from scratch can catch up the performance of those which are pre-trained.
