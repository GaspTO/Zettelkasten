* open images
* check cspnet
* add mobilenets to list
* yolo and fcos are sota for real time object detection
* cpu real time: mobilenet, shufflenet and ghostnet
* gpu real time: resnet, darkent, dla, cspnet
* worry: bad weather conditions and deep learning models
* add compressing deep neural networks with pruning trained quantization and huffman coding
* check: A first look at deep learning apps on smartphones
* Add GANs
* Yolov8



#### AREAS THAT I NEED TO LOOK MORE INTO
* Active Learning [[What I am doing]]
* Domain Adaptation
* Instance and Semantic Segmentation
* Zero, one and few shot learning
* 3D object pointcloud to voxel (according to chatgpt): 
	* OctNet: Learning Deep 3D Representations at High Resolutions
	* Frustum PointNets for 3D Object Detection from RGB-D Data
* 3D object reconstruction of pointclouds:
	* Dense 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction Using a Deep Pyramid Network
