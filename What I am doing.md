##  POINTS FROM SURVEY
* First models would first train the deep models and then *fine-tune* using AL
* CEAL was the first to integrate both deep learning and AL
* CEAL overview:

* You can look at the uncertainty about cnns to be composed by two stages. Feature extraction and task learning stage:

* LLAL is an uncertainty method and it bases itself in the idea that there is a difference between task loss and feature loss. Overview:

  * The loss prediction module is learned to predict the target loss of the unlabeled dataset, while the top-ùêæ strategy is used to select the query samples
